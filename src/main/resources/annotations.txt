“What is that incalculable feeling that deprives the mind of the sleep necessary to life?” (A.C.)
To be alive is to be soft and malleable, it is when something becomes hard and rigid, that it dies (after A.T.)
She goes around talking to the plants, certain that it will make them happy and responsive.
You send something out, uncertain whether it returns. There is not enough energy to do anything beyond that gesture. But when it returns, this insufficient energy is completed.
One says that if one repeats something over and over, always with the same results, but one waits for the outcome to be different, that is a form of insanity. But it is?
I have started to map the plate. Each particle that perhaps originally found its place by chance, now has its proper location and has its identified shape.
Phenomenology has a notion of “intention”. What does it mean that two things have the intention to come near to each other?

Horizons create space by remaining distant. But also by being in a curious distance. If there were no change as I move, that space would collapse.
Waiting to go home, but only waiting won't get me there.
“Dans la grande salle, debout derrière les comptoirs, elles attendaient les clients.” (E.Z.)
Hier wo nichts mehr warten kann, steh ich stundenlang einfach nur an (F.H.)
You told me not to contact you until we could talk in person. Now I am waiting to see how we can find each other without contact. I only know we will find each other again. We always have.
